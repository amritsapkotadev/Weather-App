# 🌤️ Weather App – React + OpenWeather API

This Weather App is a sleek, responsive, and minimalistic application built using **React** and powered by the **OpenWeatherMap API**. Designed as a learning project, it helped me grasp the complete lifecycle of working with APIs — from fetching data to rendering dynamic UI based on real-time responses.

## 🚀 Purpose

The primary goal of this project was to **deeply understand API integration** in React — covering:
- Making asynchronous API calls using `fetch`
- Handling responses, errors, and loading states
- Managing state using React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`)
- Parsing JSON data and mapping it to UI components
- Working with environment variables and API keys securely

## ✨ Features

- 🌎 **Search Weather by City**  
  Users can enter any city to get real-time weather information.

- 🌡️ **Real-time Temperature & Conditions**  
  Shows current temperature, weather description, and relevant icons.

- 🧭 **Additional Weather Details**  
  Includes humidity, wind speed, and feels-like temperature.

- 🌙 **Responsive & Clean UI**  
  Fully mobile-friendly and modern design with smooth transitions.

## 🧑‍💻 Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React (Functional Components)
- **API:** [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api)
- **CSS:** Tailwind CSS / Vanilla CSS 
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub

## 🧠 What I Learned

This project was a hands-on journey that taught me:
- How to fetch and handle external data efficiently
- Best practices for loading and error states
- How to structure components for better scalability
- Basics of working with external APIs in a secure and clean way
